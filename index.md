## Welcome to a Collection of C++, HTML, and Java Script programs
This repository I will be adding new languages as I learn them and continually updating any new programs I have written.
As I learn more languages I will update with additional languages and programs.

### Intro

After I completed my degree in Computer Science, I knew that I wanted to code.  I enjoy doing this and have found it to be rewarding and frustrating, exciting and aggravating all in one.  But the challenge of creating something and then watching it come to life and work as intended is truly amazing.  Below is a list of some of the programs I have written.  Contained within the folder is also a bunch of basic programs that I will sometimes find myself going back to reference and use to help create new programs.  

I hope that by showcasing some of the programs I have written it will help to grant me the opportunity to further my knowledge of coding and my abilities as a programmer.  It seems that finding an entry level position is not the easiest and with the pandemic I do not want my first job coding to be one that I work from home.  The value of working with someone who is experienced in the field of software development will help to expand my knowledge and allow me to grow as a programmer much faster than if I did not have that resource.  

I have tried to maintain good coding practices by making sure that I have all my code commented so it should be easy to follow along and understand my code.  I am also continuing to code all the time and will add new programs that I write to this page and move some of the less intricate programs off the front page. Below is a program I wrote while expanding my knowledge with Codecademy. 

### Dating Profile Program (C++)
This program helps to show the use of classes, objects, private, and public options in coding.  

```
//app.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "profile.hpp"

int main() {

	Profile shaun("Shaun D", 39, "Florida", "USA", "he/him");
	shaun.add_hobby("listening to audiobooks, coding, videogames, and podcasts");

	std::cout << shaun.view_profile();

	Profile julie("Julie C", 37, "Florida", "USA", "she/her");
	julie.add_hobby("Long Walks on the beach");
	julie.add_hobby("Sleeping In");
	julie.add_hobby("Vacations");

	std::cout << julie.view_profile();

}

//profile.cpp
#include "profile.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

Profile::Profile(std::string new_name, int new_age, std::string new_city, std::string new_country, std::string new_pronouns) {
    name = new_name;
    age = new_age;
    city = new_city;
    country = new_country;
    pronouns = new_pronouns;
}

void Profile::add_hobby(std::string new_hobby) {

    hobbies.push_back(new_hobby);

}

std::string Profile::view_profile() {

    std::string bio = "Name: " + name;
    bio += "\nCity: " + city;
    bio += "\nCountry: " + country;
    bio += "\nAge: " + std::to_string(age);
    bio += "\nPronouns: " + pronouns;
    std::string hobby_string = "Hobbies:\n";

    for (std::string hobby : hobbies) {

        hobby_string += " - " + hobby;

    }

    return bio + "\n" + hobby_string + "\n";
}

//profile.hpp
#pragma once
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Profile {

private:

	std::string name;
	int age;
	std::string city;
	std::string country;
	std::string pronouns;
	std::vector<std::string> hobbies;

public:

	Profile(std::string new_name, int new_age, std::string new_city, std::string new_country, std::string new_pronouns);

	std::string view_profile();

	void add_hobby(std::string new_hobby);

};

### FizzBuzz (C++)
The fizzbuzz program. 
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {

    // start of for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {

        //determine if number is divisible by 15   
        if (i % 15 == 0) {
            std::cout << "fizzbuzz\n";
        }
        //determine if number is divisible by 3
        else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            std::cout << "fizz\n";
        }
        //determine if number is divisible by 5
        else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            std::cout << "buzz\n";
        }
        //print out the rest of the numbers
        else {
            std::cout << i << "\n";
        }
    }
}
```
### MadLib program/game (HTML, JavaScript, & .css)

This is a program for a madlib game that I wrote while learning the HTML language.  This uses forms as well as all types of inputs for those forms.  It uses a .css file to design the page.

```

</html>

```

This is the main javascript file

```
// JavaScript source code
// Grab values from the submitted form in the URL
const words = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

// Cleans up and capitalizes the names of the animals
function cleanAndCap(str) {
    if (!str) return null
    let temp = str.trim()
    return temp[0].toUpperCase() + temp.substring(1)
}

// Assigning the variables with values used in the story
const firstAnimal = cleanAndCap(words.get('animal-1'));
const secondAnimal = cleanAndCap(words.get('animal-2'));

const answer = cleanAndCap(words.get('answer'));
const conjunction = answer === 'Yes' ? 'and' : 'but';

const speed = words.get('speed');
const adj1 = words.get('adj-1');

const thirdAnimal = cleanAndCap(words.get('animal-3'));
const quote = words.get('quote');

const verb1 = words.get('verb-1');
const num1 = words.get('num-1');
const message = words.get('message');

// The string containing HTML and text which will populate the story.html page
const story = `<p>A <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was making fun of the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> one day for being so slow.</p>
<p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>
<p>"<span class="word" title="id: answer">${answer}</span>," replied the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span>, "${conjunction} I get there <span class="word" title="id: speed">${speed}</span> than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."</p>
<p>The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was much <span class="word" title="id: adj-1">${adj1}</span> at the idea of running a race with the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <span class="word" title="id: animal-3">${thirdAnimal}</span>, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, "<span class="word" title="id: quote">${quote}</span>".</p>
<p>The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span>, he went off the course to practice <span class="word" title="id: verb-1">${verb1}</span> for <span class="word" title="id: num-1">${num1}</span> hours until the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> should catch up.</p>
<p>The <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <span class="word" title="animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was <span class="word" title="id: verb-1">${verb1}</span>. The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was so caught up in <span class="word" title="id: verb-1">${verb1}</span>; and when at last he did stop, the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> was near the goal. The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> in time.</p>`;

// Grabbing the title element
const title = document.getElementById('title');
// Populating the title element with text
title.innerHTML = `The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> And The  <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span>`;

// Grabbing the story element
const storyEl = document.getElementById('story');
// Populating the story element with the value of the story variable
storyEl.innerHTML = story;

// Grabbing the moral-message element
const moralMessage = document.getElementById('moral-message');
// Populating the moral-message element with text
moralMessage.innerHTML = `<span class="italics" title="id: message">"${message}"</span>`;

### Guessing Game (C++)

This is a guessing game which will show the ability to utilize different functions which call on variables that where output by other functions.  It also shows the ability to check values and make sure that inaccurate values that might be entered will not be accepted.

```
//main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>
#include "game.hpp"

using namespace std;

int guess;
int number;
int cycles;
int balance = 100;
string player;

int main() {

	greet();

	cout << "Please enter your name: " << endl;
	cin >> player;

	//loop to cycle through the gameplay while funds are available and track the number of bets placed.
	while (balance > 0) {

		int bet = getbet(balance);
		cout << player << ": ";
		int game = gamechoice();
		int win_loss = letsplay(game);
		int upbalance = update_balance(win_loss, bet, balance);
		balance = upbalance;
		cout << endl;
		cout << player << " your current balance is: " << balance << endl << endl;
		cycles++;
	}

	cout << endl << "Total number of bets made: " << cycles << endl << endl;
	cout << player << ", that was a good try!" << endl;
	gameover();

}

//game.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "game.hpp"

using namespace std;

//This function opens up the game and explains the rules
void greet() {

	cout << "Welcome to the guessing game!" << endl;
	cout << "Choosing the different games will provide you with different winning odds" << endl;
	cout << "Picking number out of 10 will provide you with 9 to 1 odds" << endl;
	cout << "Picking number out of 50 will provide you with 49 to 1 odds" << endl;
	cout << "Picking number out of 100 will provide you with 99 to 1 odds" << endl;

}

//This function will get the bet, check it against the balance to ensure the bet is good and return the bet value
int getbet(int balance) {

	bool goodbet;
	cout << "Your current balance is: " << balance << endl;
	int bet = 0;
	cout << "Enter the amount you would like to bet: " << endl;
	cin >> bet;
	cout << "You have wagered " << bet << endl;
	while (goodbet = true)
		if (bet <= balance) {
			return bet;
			goodbet == true;
		}
		else {
			cout << "Please bet an amount less than balance." << endl;
			cout << "Your current balance is: " << balance << endl;

			return choice;
			goodchoice == true;
		}
		else {
			cout << "You have not selected a proper choice" << endl;
			cout << "Plese select 1, 2, or 3: " << endl;
			cout << "Enter your choice: ";
			cin >> choice;
		}
}

//This funciton takes the game selected and then returns if the player won or lost and which game they played
int letsplay(int game) {

	int guess;

	if (game == 1) {
		int com_num = rand() % 10;
		//used this to check for winner and loser properly
		//cout << com_num;
		cout << "Please choose a number between 0 and 10: " << endl;
		cin >> guess;

		if (com_num == guess) {
			cout << "You have won!" << endl;
			return 1;
		}

### Whale talk program (JavaScript)

This is program which takes a string, inputs it into an array, removes the items wanted from that array and alters other items 
within that array.  It then provides an output of the array converted back into a string form.

```
// JavaScript source code
///creation of statement which needs to be changed into whale talk
const input = 'This sentence is translated to whale talk';
//creating an array to compare that consists of whale talk language..only vowels
const vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'];
//creation of blank array to store results in
const resultArray = [];
//creation of for loop to iterate through the input text
for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    //creation of for loop to compare vowels array to input array
    for (let j = 0; j < vowels.length; j++) {
        //condition if input iteration = vowels iteration
        if (input[i] === vowels[j]) {
            //addition of met condition to resultArray array
            resultArray.push(input[i])
        }
    }
    //adding an additional e if the result is an e
    if (input[i] === 'e')
        resultArray.push('e');
    //adding an additional u if the result is a u
    if (input[i] === 'u')
        resultArray.push('u');
}
//printing the resultArray array to the console
console.log(resultArray);
//creating a variable named whaleTalk to store the resultArray as one sentence
let whaleTalk = resultArray.join('');
//printing the resultArray with the join command
console.log(resultArray.join(''));
//printing the created variable whaleTalk 
console.log(whaleTalk);
```

### TicTacToe (C++)

Below is a TicTacToe game I wrote while completing the same course on Codecademy.  

```
//ttt.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "ttt.hpp"

int main() {

	greet();
	displayboard();
	playerselection();
	endgame();
}

//tttfunctions.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

//Define functions

// greet shows the opening and explains the rules
void greet() {

    std::cout << "========================\n";
    std::cout << "=Welcome to Tic Tac Toe=\n";
    std::cout << "========================\n\n";
    std::cout << "This is a two player game.  \nPlayer one will be X and Player two will be O\n";
    std::cout << "Below is the board please select a number \nto select your location on the board.\n\n";
}
// shows board placement in the beggining of the game
void displayboard() {

    std::cout << " 1 | 2 | 3 \n";
    std::cout << "===========\n";
    std::cout << " 4 | 5 | 6 \n";
    std::cout << "===========\n";
    std::cout << " 7 | 8 | 9 \n";

}
// main loop for gameplay.  
void playerselection() {

    //declaring values
    int winner = 0;
    int turns;
    int xselect;

    //declaring vectors for board
    std::vector<char> row1(3);
    std::vector<char> row2(3);
    std::vector<char> row3(3);

    //for loop which conditions a winner and total number of turns
    for (turns = 0; winner != 1 && turns < 9; turns++) {

        //getting info from player for selection of location
        std::cout << "Please make a selection: \n";
        std::cin >> xselect;

        //determining and placing pieces on the gameboard through use of vectors
        if (turns % 2 == 0) {
            if (xselect == 1) {
                row1[0] = 'X';
            }
            else if (xselect == 2) {
                row1[1] = 'X';
            }
            else if (xselect == 3) {
                row1[2] = 'X';
            }
            else if (xselect == 4) {
                row2[0] = 'X';
            }
            else if (xselect == 5) {
